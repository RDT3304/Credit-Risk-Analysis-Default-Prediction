Slide 1: Introduction
Title: Credit Risk Analysis: Predicting Loan Defaults

Objective:
The primary objective is to build a predictive model that identifies the likelihood of a client defaulting on a loan.
Secondarily, the project aims to understand the key variables that contribute to loan defaults.
Overall, the goal is to empower financial institutions in making informed and efficient decisions regarding loan approvals.

Slide 2: Overview
Title: Problem Statement & Purpose

Problem Statement: Managing credit risk is crucial for financial stability. The defaulting of loans has both financial and reputational implications for institutions.

Purpose:
To utilize machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults accurately.
To identify key variables that influence the risk of default.

------
Slide 3: Data Insights
Title: Dataset & Features

Features:
Personal Information: ID, Age
Financial Information: Income, Home Ownership (Own, Mortgage, Rent), Employment Length, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Percentage of Income going towards loan, Previous Default Records, Length of Credit History.
Target Variable:
Status: Indicates whether the loan is Fully Paid, Charged Off, or Current. This is our target variable for prediction.

------
Slide 4: Methodology
Title: Approach & Process

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Identified outliers, missing values, and did data imputation where necessary.
Feature Engineering: Created new variables that might affect the target.
Model Selection: Employed algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM among others.
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were used.
Deployment: Future scope to integrate the model into live decision-making systems.

------
Slide 5: Tools & Technologies
Title: Technical Stack

Programming Language: Python
Data Manipulation: Pandas
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, PyCaret
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

------
Slide 6: Model Metrics
Title: How Well Did We Do?

Test Accuracy: A remarkable 93.22%, indicating the model's high reliability in predicting loan defaults.
Precision: At 93.96%, the model has a very low rate of false positives.
Recall: The model correctly identifies approximately 73.65% of all actual defaults.
F1 Score: A score of 82.58% suggests a balanced model.
AUC-ROC: An excellent score of 96.14% confirms the quality and robustness of the model.

------
Slide 7: Interpretation & Implications
Title: What Does This Mean for Us?

Precision: The high precision means that loans labeled as 'default' are indeed very likely to default, safeguarding the institution from financial loss.

Recall: While the recall isn't as high as precision, it's still significant. It means we are capturing a large proportion of potential defaults, thereby reducing risk.

------
Slide 8: Next Steps & Future Work
Title: Where Do We Go From Here?

Feature Engineering: Further refinement can improve the model.
Dataset: Include more variables that could influence credit risk.
Updates: The model should be regularly updated to adapt to financial landscape changes.

------
Slide 9: Conclusion
Title: Final Takeaways

The model has shown strong performance in both testing and validation phases, making it both practical and reliable.
It stands to benefit all stakeholders involved by promising more informed, efficient, and responsible lending practices.
